            <div class="poem-text">
                <p>I am building altars from salt<br>
                and the small deaths you leave behind:<br>
                coffee grounds in the sink,<br>
                your name half-erased from my phone,<br>
                the way you say "maybe tomorrow"<br>
                like a prayer I'm not allowed to answer.</p>

                <p>What do I sacrifice here?<br>
                Every morning I don't text you first.<br>
                Every night I don't dream your face<br>
                into the space beside me.</p>

                <p>The salt dissolves when it rains.<br>
                I rebuild it anyway,<br>
                grain by grain,<br>
                until my hands are raw<br>
                and my mouth tastes like the ocean<br>
                where all the drowned prayers go.</p>

                <p>You are made of sugar and lightning,<br>
                sharp enough to cut clean through<br>
                but sweet enough that I keep<br>
                putting my neck on the block.</p>

                <p>Every "good morning" is a small execution.<br>
                Every "sleep well" drops the blade.<br>
                I collect the pieces of myself<br>
                in mason jars, label them<br>
                by date and intensity of ache.</p>

                <p>When you smile,<br>
                the crowd cheers.<br>
                When you leave,<br>
                they sweep up what's left of me<br>
                and throw it to the birds.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow I'll climb the scaffold again,<br>
                adjust the blindfold,<br>
                and wait for you to say my name<br>
                like it's the last word<br>
                I'll ever need to hear.</p>

                Not in flames, but in the quiet way<br>
                that words turn to dust<br>
                when you read them too many times,<br>
                when you press your thumb<br>
                against the same sentence<br>
                until the ink bleeds through your skin.</p>

                <p>I am walking through the ruins now,<br>
                kicking at the remnants<br>
                of stories I once believed<br>
                could save me from myself.</p>

                <p>Here: the ashes of every love poem<br>
                I copied into margins.<br>
                There: the spine of a philosophy book<br>
                that taught me how to think<br>
                but not how to stop.</p>

                <p>The librarian is long gone.<br>
                I am alone with the catalog<br>
                of everything I've lost to language,<br>
                writing my name in the dust<br>
                with a finger that remembers<br>
                how to turn pages<br>

                <p>I am mapping the places where time breaks:<br>
                3:17 AM when your text lights up my phone,<br>
                the moment between waking and remembering<br>
                that you're not here,<br>
                the second before you say goodbye<br>
                and the hour after you're gone.</p>

                <p>Here be dragons:<br>
                the kitchen where we fought<br>
                about nothing and everything,<br>
                the bookstore aisle where you first<br>
                told me you loved me,<br>
                the parking lot where we learned<br>
                that some things can't be taken back.</p>

                <p>I draw latitude and longitude<br>
                around the shape of your absence,<br>
                mark each coordinate<br>
                where memory bends<br>
                like light around a star.</p>

                <p>Somewhere in this geography<br>
                there's a place where all our almosts<br>
                live together,<br>
                where the roads we didn't take<br>
                converge in a city<br>
                I'll never be able to visit.</p>

                <p>Winter's not a season,<br>
                it's a state of mind<br>
                I've been living in<br>
                since you stopped<br>
                calling my name<br>
                like it meant coming home.</p>

                <p>The snow inside my chest<br>
                doesn't melt in spring.<br>
                It just gets older,<br>
                harder,<br>
                until I'm walking around<br>
                with a glacier for a heart<br>
                and frostbite in my fingertips<br>
                every time I reach for the phone.</p>

                <p>Sometimes I wonder<br>
                if you feel the cold too,<br>
                if your breath fogs<br>
                when you say someone else's name<br>
                with the same tenderness<br>
                you used to save for mine.</p>

                <p>But I think you're living<br>
                in a different climate now,<br>
                where the sun actually sets<br>
                and rises again,<br>
                where winter is just<br>
                something that happens<br>
                and then ends.</p>

            <h3>Cathedral of Ruin</h3>
            <div class="poem-text">
                <p>I built a cathedral from my ribs<br>
                and lit every vein like a candle.<br>
                The saints turned their faces,<br>
                the angels split their wings in shame,<br>
                but I prayed anyway ‚Äî<br>
                not to heaven, not to mercy ‚Äî<br>
                only to the shape of your shadow<br>
                etched across my skull.</p>

                <p>If you enter me,<br>
                the bells will shatter themselves to ringing.<br>
                If you leave me,<br>
                let the pews drown in ash.<br>
                I will crawl through fire like a supplicant,<br>
                I will name you in smoke<br>
                until the air itself becomes unbreathable.</p>

            <div class="poem-text">
                <p>Your absence is a famine,<br>
                a hollow that eats bone.<br>
                I starve on your silence,<br>
                gnawing the marrow of memory<br>
                until my mouth tastes only rust.</p>

                <p>What god made me this way ‚Äî<br>
                a beast chained to your footsteps?<br>
                If you turned once, just once,<br>
                I would break every chain,<br>
                devour the sky itself,<br>
                swallow the stars like seeds<br>
                just to plant your name in my blood.</p>

                <p>Bury me, but not in soil.<br>
                Bury me in the syllables of your name.<br>
                Carve it into my coffin lid,<br>
                let worms read it as scripture.</p>

                <p>The mourners will not understand.<br>
                They will whisper of madness,<br>
                of blasphemy, of ruin.<br>
                But when I claw from the grave,<br>
                when my mouth is dirt and thunder,<br>
                it will not be God I cry for.<br>
                It will be you. Always you.</p>

                <p>There is a door behind your sternum<br>
                that only opens when you're not looking.<br>
                I've been waiting there for hours,<br>
                patient as a prayer,<br>
                watching the lock turn silver in your sleep.</p>
                
                <p>If you opened it,<br>
                what would spill out?<br>
                Months of almosts, maybe.<br>
                The weight of every word I never said<br>
                hanging in the air like snow<br>
                that refuses to fall.</p>
                
                <p>I think I know the combination now:<br>
                your middle name backwards,<br>
                the number of times you've almost left,<br>
                the exact shade of blue<br>
                your sorrow wears on Sundays.</p>
